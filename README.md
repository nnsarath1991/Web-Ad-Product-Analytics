# Web-Ad-Product-Analytics

This project is built for a data challenge to predict customer churn and failure rates on a Online Learning Platform. I've conducted exploratory data analysis, multiple statistical tests to find the right business metrics holding the predictive power for the models. Please go through the R Markdown HTML knitted document for further details. 

Contact me for any suggestions or doubts!
